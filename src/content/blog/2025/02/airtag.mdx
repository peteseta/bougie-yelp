From u/hackernudes on the [YC forum thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43196207):
> Apple devices listen for BLE advertisements of a certain form to indicate a "Find My" network lost device.

> The lost device advertisements mainly contain the public key part of a key pair.

> The public key does not fit in the in payload of the advertisements, so it is stuffed into the address field. Edit: Only 46 bits of the full 224 bit public key is stored in the address field.

> In general anyone can make a "lost device" advertisement as demonstrated by OpenHayStack. The requirement is the address field needs to be fully controllable.

> BLE advertisements have a header that indicates what kind of address is present (specified by 3 bits: Public, NRPA, RPA, Random Static). The lost device advertisements are supposed to be "Random Static", but the researchers found that Apple "Find My" listeners ("finders") will accept advertisements for any address type.

> They use this fact to generate the private key part of a public key that matches an existing host adapter BLE address. The host adapter BLE address cannot generally be changed unless user has root/superuser privileges. This step is computationally expensive. However, private keys can be precomputed (rainbow tables) because a large chunk of the address is a manufacturer code (OUI).
