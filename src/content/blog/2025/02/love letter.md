A goodbye to Elaine Gu: I’m sorry I didn’t run to catch up with you or tap you or anything at all. I will most likely never see you again.

A goodbye to skiing.

You know, there has got to be some kind of meaning to find. I’ve sent and been sent a lot of stuff on agi, timelines, export control, general geopolitical bickering. Honestly reading too much is bad. It drives you to feel disenchanted with what you’ve made of yourself thus far—lost, fragile, whatever.

My priorities shift, and the new, supposedly important ones never materialize—I never give them a catalyst, for whatever reason. And the old ones? They quickly retire to the idyll. Do you ever look back a year and evaluate what you had planned for today?

I make music but the lull is transient. It doesn’t fill the other holes anymore. I sit interviews and give them the best version of me, as if I could conjure him at will. Discrete math drives me insane.

The silver lining is that all of this fades, it always does. The excitement comes back, and I guess that is the part to look forward to. Because having nothing to lose means you have nothing, and the way you have stuff to lose is to go do uncomfortable things. This is advice I give but can never seem to follow. It is self sabotage at the highest level.
