The prompt:

```
My favourite mode of transportation in Bangkok is to take the BTS/MRT/Airport Rail Link as far as it will go, and then order a GrabBike that will take me the rest of the way there. Sometimes, if the starting train station is far, I need to GrabBike from where I am to the station, take the train, then take GrabBike again for the “last mile.”

Design the backend logic and frontend interface of a web app similar to Google Maps that will compute the optimal route (by time and by cost) using this method, and includes an estimate time. It should be mobile optimized.

Estimated times should be informed by Google Maps, as they do have bike traffic data. Google Maps also shows the estimated cost of a certain train route, but this may not be a public API.

Train costs should be derived as follows:
- The app should have a toggle for whether the 20B flat fare policy is in effect. This would give a flat fare pricing of 20 THB per trip across the BTS, MRT, and ARL.
- Otherwise, use published fares.

GrabBike has a starting fare of 25 THB for the first 2 kilometers, with a subsequent fare of 5 THB per kilometer for trips up to 5 kilometers. For trips longer than 5 kilometers, the starting fare is 50 THB.

Help me plan how this webapp will work.
